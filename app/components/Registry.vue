        Your presence at our wedding truly means the world to us. We are so grateful to celebrate this special day with the people we love most.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-6">
        As we begin our new life together, we’ve chosen not to create a traditional gift registry. Instead, if you feel inclined to give a gift, we would deeply appreciate a contribution towards our future—whether it's our home, travel, or shared dreams.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-8">
        Most importantly, we’re just so happy to celebrate with you!
