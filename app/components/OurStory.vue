              We met on a sunny afternoon in May 2018 at a local farmer's market.
              Alexander was buying wildflowers, and Madeline was there with
              friends. Our eyes met across a display of sunflowers, and we've been
              inseparable ever since.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Our first date was a picnic in the park surrounded by wildflowers.
              Two years later, Alexander proposed in that same spot, with a ring
              nestled among a bouquet of freshly picked wildflowers.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              We've shared countless adventures togetherâ€”hiking mountain trails,
              road trips to the coast, cooking elaborate meals, and quiet evenings
              watching our favorite shows. We can't wait to begin this next
              chapter of our lives together.
