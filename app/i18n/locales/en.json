      "In 2019, while traveling in New Zealand, Alex met someone who would eventually lead him to Germany — and to Madeline. What started as a spontaneous visit turned into something much more.",
      "They kept in touch across time zones, voice messages turning into plans, and eventually, a return trip to see each other again. A road trip through Austria sealed the deal — they knew they had something real.",
      "From the Canadian prairies to small-town Germany, through freezing winters and pandemic delays, they made it work. Now, after years of long-distance and adventure, they’re finally ready to start the next chapter — together."
