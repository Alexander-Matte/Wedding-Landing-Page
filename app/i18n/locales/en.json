      "In 2019, while traveling through New Zealand, Alex ended up working in the wine vineyards where he met a friendly German guy — spoiler alert: Madeline’s brother. The two hit it off, and the invitation was casually extended: if Alex ever found himself in Germany, he should drop by. On his way back to Canada, Alex made a spontaneous detour to Europe to visit his new friend in Germany and another buddy in the Netherlands.",
      "While staying with the family in Germany, Alex met Madeline — and it quickly became clear there was something special between them. After leaving, they kept in touch, exchanging voice messages constantly while Alex was working as a spray plane ground crew member in Saskatchewan. The early mornings gave them more time to talk before the time difference pulled them apart each day.",
      "As their connection deepened, Alex booked a return trip to Germany — this time just to see Madeline. They spent three unforgettable weeks road-tripping through Austria, passing the ultimate relationship test: traveling together nonstop. Not only were they not sick of each other, but by the end of the trip, they decided to give a long-distance relationship a real shot (even if Alex initially said, “Let’s not put a label on it” — classic move).",
      "After another tough goodbye, Alex returned to Canada and jumped back into oil rig work to save up quickly. Then Madeline made a bold move — visiting him in February — in Saskatchewan — where temperatures regularly drop below -40°C. She stayed with him through the freezing cold and long days on the rig, happy just to be together. That’s when Alex knew she was truly serious.",
      "Her flight back was canceled as COVID hit, and while part of Alex hoped she might stay longer, they both knew she had to return. That time together solidified their plans: Alex would move to Germany, and they’d build a life together. That was back in 2020, and they haven’t looked back since — despite the challenges of adjusting to a new country, culture, and language.",
      "After all the years of distance, hard goodbyes, and heartfelt reunions, Alex and Madeline are thrilled to finally say 'I do' and begin the next chapter — together, for good."
