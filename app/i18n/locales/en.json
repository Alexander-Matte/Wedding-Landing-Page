          "In 2019, during a trip through New Zealand, Alex was working in the vineyards where he met a friendly German — spoiler: Madeline’s brother. The two quickly hit it off, and the invitation was casually extended: if Alex ever found himself in Germany, he should stop by. On his way back to Canada, Alex made a spontaneous detour to Europe to visit his new friend in Germany and another buddy in the Netherlands.",
          "During his stay with the family in Germany, Alex met Madeline – and it quickly became clear that there was something special between them. After he left, they stayed in touch, constantly exchanging voice messages while Alex worked as a ground crew member for a crop-dusting company in Saskatchewan. The early mornings gave them more time to talk before the time difference pulled them apart each day.",
          "As their connection deepened, Alex booked a return trip to Germany — this time just to see Madeline. They spent three unforgettable weeks road-tripping through Austria and passed the ultimate relationship test: traveling together nonstop. Not only were they not annoyed with each other, but by the end of the trip, they decided to really try a long-distance relationship (even though Alex initially said, “Let’s not label it” — classic move).",
          "After another difficult goodbye, Alex returned to Canada and jumped back into oil drilling work to save up quickly. Then Madeline made a bold move — she visited him in February — in Saskatchewan — where temperatures regularly drop below -40°C. She stayed with him through the freezing cold and long days on the oil rig, just happy to be together. That’s when Alex knew she truly meant it.",
          "Her return flight was canceled due to COVID, and although part of Alex hoped she would stay longer, they both knew she had to go back. That time together solidified their plans: Alex would move to Germany, and they would build a life together. That was in 2020, and they’ve never looked back — despite the challenges of adjusting to a new country, culture, and language.",
          "After all the years of distance, hard goodbyes, and heartfelt reunions, Alex and Madeline are overjoyed to finally say 'I do' and begin the next chapter — together, forever."
